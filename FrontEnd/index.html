				<h1><u>Crime Data Trends</u></h1>
				<p>&emsp;Hello! This is a project that analyzes a set of crime data from Los Angeles from 2019 to present. We used the data to form a database and show trends for the crimes in Los Angeles.</p>
				<p>&emsp;The data we used contains a paramount set of years to be analyzing how crime is recorded. During 2020, many individuals realized the implicit biases and injustices that reside with United States law enforcement. Our project not only aims to visualize and present trends relating to crime in general, but also the issues that may exist in our justice system.</p>

				<h1><u>Trends</u></h1>
				<p>The trends we are analyzing are shown on the left of the screen. They are, arrests by race, theft by season, gun crimes, female victims, and crime by location.</p>
				<p><b>Arrests by Race</b> This trend is the number of arrests made by month. The data is then categorized into four different race classifications. Black, White, Latine, and Asian. It is important to note that the race provided is the race of the victim of the recorded crime.</p>
				<p><b>Theft by Season</b> This trend is the relative change in petty theft by season.</p>
				<p><b>Gun Crimes</b> This trend is the change in gun crimes by month. With this trend, you are able to compare between years. Gun crimes is an unspecific term which includes crimes committed with all types of guns</p>
				<p><b>Female Victims</b> This trend is categorizing female victims by their age and week in the year when the crime occurred.</p>
				<p><b>Crime by Local</b> This trend finds the specific locations that most crimes occur at. These locations are not specific counties in LA, but premises such as the Street, Alley, or Nightclub.</p>
