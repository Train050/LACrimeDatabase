				<h1><u>Gun Crimes</u></h1>
				<p>&emsp;This graph compares the change in number of gun crimes between months and years. "Gun" crimes is a very general statement, as crime is documented with specific kinds of guns as the weapons. For example, a rifle, handgun, and shotgun are all classified as different weapons. This graph takes into account all of them.</p>
				<p>As mentioned before, this graph captures a very interesting point in time in the US. As the pandemic struck, many things changed, but an important date is April of 2020 when a nearly national stay at home order was issued. Around this time, gun crimes began to steadily rise.</p>
				<p>While not equating the two, the increasing gun violence phenomena can be drawn parallel to the largely studied link between sports games and domestic violence. As pressures in the home increase, so does a rate of violence.</p>
				<p>The murder of George Floyd also occurred the next month in May in 2020. Although the first protest in LA didn't occur until June 3rd</p>
